# goal
Actively developed, this was my attempt to handle relational databases and forms in an abstract way.

While most functionality is generic, this particular implementation (i.e. db and few custom files), is about a simple stock and invoicing system.

From commit on 2020-01-16 set up should be relatively easy (only editing public/index.php and Configuration/Constants.php is required).
