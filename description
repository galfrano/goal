Architecture overview

* public/ index.php, css/*, script.js
	obviously, entry point, public files.
* Service/Router
	checks authentication, takes only first part of the path to start a controller and forwards the rest of it to initialize it.
* Service/User
	layer above Entity(user), handles session and crud. // TODO: consider extending Entity and passing the rest of the functionality to login controller
* Service/Rest
	for external connections, not a priority for now.
* Service/FileManager
	its use is mostly for Model/dbname/
*



Specific implementation overview

*** ROUTING ***

- CRUD
crud/users/page/1 									(read - prepare delete)
p crud/users/page/4/ -> crud/users/page/4/ 			(delete)
crud/users/page/1/new/ 								(read empty - prepare create)
crud/users/page/4/edit/35 							(read one - prepare edit)
p crud/users/page/1/new/ -> crud/users/page/4 		(create)
p crud/users/page/4/edit/35 -> crud/users/edit/35 	(edit)

- SALESREP (security, ownership)
sales/customers (owner's crud)
sales/invoices (owner's cr) one category

- ADMIN
admin/reports/view/sales/20200115-20201131	(view name, dates/filters)
admin/product-price-categories (crud)
admin/products (product -prices crud)
admin/inbound (inbound crud)
admin/invoices (invoice crud)
admin/warehouses (custom controller)
admin/cancel

- USER RIGHTS
* row specific (requires user field)
* controller specific


//dario

soft delete
move inbound
outbound (comment pids, qties)
total sales (filters)


log through types (timestamps, ) and one def of foreign key (config->userTable)

crud controllers should have their own sub-menu configuration 
we will hanldle two levels for now: controller->entity->action
eg reports->sales->march
eg representativeCrud->invoices->create
configuration needs list of controllers available for each user level -> security will be handled by router


user system => user restricted table has these access levels: user, group, public (and admin), these groups given by a column in the table itself. groups, user_groups, and users are required.
