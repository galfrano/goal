Architecture overview

* public/ index.php, css/*, script.js
	obviously, entry point, public files.
* Service/Router
	checks authentication, takes only first part of the path to start a controller and forwards the rest of it to initialize it.
* Service/User
	layer above Entity(user), handles session and crud. // TODO: consider extending Entity and passing the rest of the functionality to login controller
* Service/Rest
	for external connections, not a priority for now.
* Service/FileManager
	its use is mostly for Model/dbname/
*
